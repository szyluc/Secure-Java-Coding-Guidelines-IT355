The purpose of this rule is to make sure that when we are using methods that read bytes or characters such as InputStream.read() or Reader.read(), we need to test whether the return value is a –1 which signifies an end of stream for both of these methods or if its either a byte or a character depending on the called method.
Often times users will just cast the return value to either a byte or character depending on what they are working with right away, but if you don’t check whether the value was a –1 as an integer before casting, you will not be able to tell if you are reading the end of stream or if it is a character or a byte that you are reading.
You must make sure that you check the return value first as an integer and if it is not –1 then you can cast it and do whatever you need to do otherwise you know you have reached the end of the input stream.
