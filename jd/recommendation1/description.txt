This recommendation focuses on using file name conventions that ensure your software runs as intended and is properly secured.
The rule notes that you should avoid a variety of characters when creating or taking in the name of a file for it to be a proper file name.
The characters which you should avoid according to the rule include leading dashes, control characters, spaces, invalid character encodings, and namespace prefixes or conventions.
The avoidance of these characters ensures that your software will operate as expected in different environments and will prevent security issues that can be introduced otherwise.
If any of these characters are used it may lead to improper interpretation of the file and or allow files to used as an attack surface by bad actors.
The way it recommends to avoid these problems is to simply check any input from untrusted sources such as a user for any of the things we mentioned and ensure you handle the case where the operating system your software is running on blocks a file with that name properly.
