The implementation of this recommendation makes sure that commonly overlooked details when creating a file are properly taken care of.
Some of those things include, checking whether the file already exists, handling when the file is not able to be created, and ensuring the file has proper permissions.
It mentions that most of the time file creating is usually done with just a single method call and these details are frequently looked over which can lead to a variety of problems.
If handled improperly you could overwrite existing files, create race conditions which can be exploited, and having improper permissions on the files that you are working with.
In order to avoid all of these problems, the rule simply recommends using a newer method implemented in java which creates files atomically and handles cases such as the file already existing which eliminates the forementioned problems which is java.nio.file.Files.newOutputStream().
So long as you are using this method for file creation, you can avoid all those problems including permission issues and safe creation of the file.
