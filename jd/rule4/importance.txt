The reason this rule is important is that if you aren’t careful and normalizing your external input strings before validating them, there are some things that can slip through the cracks and cause problems that could have been prevented.
There are certain situations where things such as XML tags that a user is trying to inject will slip through your validation checks even if you specifically check for what they are doing if you do not perform the validation first as there can be ambiguity in the interpretation.
If you were to just simply perform the normalization first as this rule lays out, the string would be in its true final representation, and the validation checks would works as expected and protect the system which is why it is so important to follow this rule.
Otherwise, your system will be subject to other attacks, especially different injections which are already something that is popular, and people will be looking for which is why you need to follow these practices.
