This rule is meant to prevent the use of fields that are public, static, and nonfinal as it can lead to a bunch of issues that can be easily avoided with a few quick changes as we will discuss.
Any field that is both public and static allows client code to easily access that field since there is no security checks which creates a lot of problems if that value is not final meaning it can also be modified by the client which brings us right into our first solution to this problem.
It is also mentioned how the use of public static nonfinal fields also introduces issues with type-safety, can be modified inconsistently in threads, and can’t validate values before they are set which just adds to the list of problems they create.
For our first solution to this problem, if the value that you are making public and static does not need to change then you can simply just make it final as well which will prevent it from being modifiable which is what introduces a ton of security concerns in the first place as we discussed.
If it happens that the value needs to be changed and cannot be a final value, the other option is to make it a private value instead. This prevents access from the client without security checks and you can simply create setters and getters as you normally would for a private value to read as well as set the value.
