The reason this recommendation is so important is because what developers expect the order of operations to be and what they are does not usually align so this ensures that the software will operate as intended so long as you provide it clear order of operations using parentheses.
Aside from the fact that without clearly outlining the order the software may not work as expected, it will also often confuse other people who are working on or reviewing that code.
Even if you have modified the order to work properly based on the true order of operations for this language, others may read it another way not knowing the true order of operations and misunderstanding how it works which we want to avoid as well.
Simply adding parentheses makes it much easier for everyone working with the code to understand, ensures that the machine is producing the calculation that is expected, and just makes sure that everybody is on the same page including the machines and the developers which is very important to make sure the software works as originally intended.
