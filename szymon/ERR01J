ERR01J: Do not allow exceptions to expose sensitive information
Description:
When implementing exception handling in your code, make sure that the exceptions do not provide any sensitive information on how the program is structured and organized. Proper programs will filter out any sensitive information before displaying the error message. 
Why is it important:
This is important because attackers can manipulate exception handling in your code to gain a better understanding of which vulnerabilities may be present in the structure of your project. By identifying these vulnerabilities, it is easier for them to find exploits. For example, an OutOfMemoryError may give an attacker an idea of how to carry out a denial of service (DoS) attack against your system.
