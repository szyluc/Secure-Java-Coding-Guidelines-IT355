/*
A common malicious tactic to attack programs is to cause DoS attacks. In Java, this can be done through overloading 
the program by bloating the heap to such a degree that the garbage collector cannot compensate on time. While not 
being the programmer’s fault, there are ways to mitigate these potential attacks by ensuring the code is efficient for 
the garbage collector’s behalf. This can be done through a multitude of ways, such as ensuring the use of short-lived 
immutable objects so that younger generations of garbage collection have less intensive proprotional to the number of 
live objects in that generation; utilize smaller objects when possible; and prevent explicitly calling the garbage 
collector and allow it to do its job.

By following these practices, you can ensure your garbage collector works efficiently enough to be able to effectively
relieve the heap without getting bloated by code or unnecessary manual calls (when done incorrectly) ensuring that it 
can counter malicious events at hindering the program.

  // Here, the temp object remains short lived as it stays withing this method and nowhere else, and furthermore, we allow
  // the garbage collector to do all the work, not calling it voluntarily
