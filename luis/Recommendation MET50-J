/*
While overloading can be a useful tool in Java, not being careful in how you pass parameters in methods 
or constructors can lead to incorrect results in the code potentially incorrectly interpreting the wrong 
function. The best way to prevent this issue is to be careful on how you pass overloaded functions and, 
in the case two functions are similar, overgo overloading altogether and just give it a new function name. 

This can ensure transperency not only for the program, but also make things clearer for the programmers by 
not being flooded with unneeded nuance in interpreting the overloaded functions and make code cleaner.
