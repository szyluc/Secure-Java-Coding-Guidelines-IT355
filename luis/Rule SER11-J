SER11-J: Prevent overwriting of externalizable objects

For code that utilizes the Externalizable interface and its respective methods, it will 
allow for any code to have access. To ensure only authorized code can utilize it, 
it must have checks to avoid overwriting, such as Booleans that hold flags. 

This is a simple rule to prevent multiple initialization and is mostly made to avoid 
unauthorized multiple overwriting. It is by no means a substitute to protect sensitive data.
