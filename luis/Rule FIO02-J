/*
FIO02-J: Detect and handle file-related errors

When handling file error checks, make sure you actually account for them since Java, 
as a language, gives return values to file executions, such as the delete()command. 

This actually ensures that you don’t just assume simply calling a file command did 
the job but that a correct result occurred by checking the return of a command.

File foo = new File("foo");
if(!file.delete()){
  //Deletion failed, handle error
}
