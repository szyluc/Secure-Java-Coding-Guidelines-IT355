/*
  Oftentimes, the creation of a temporary file is made to share data, remember auxiliary information, 
  load classes and more. These temp files are, at the end of the day, still files, and must therefore 
  abide by other rules of file handling. To ensure that proper handling of these files are undertaken 
  and avoid abnormal termination, avoid using finally blocks of code and do not use deleteOnExit() 
  commands as they may not finish within the frame of when the file should be removed and with deleteOnExit(), 
  once it has been called it cannot be undone. The best option is to call DELETE_ON_CLOSE when calling a 
  BufferedWriter as it will always close and remove the temporary file when it is out of scope. 

  In the event that a temporary file is not removed properly, that file name nor the resources to that 
  file are not properly recycled. Moreso, there is no one surefire way to remove a file that fits all 
  scenarios, so programmers must be aware of what situation is needed for each scenario. That’s why many 
  systems even utilize temporary file remover systems, and many of these services can be utilized manually.
