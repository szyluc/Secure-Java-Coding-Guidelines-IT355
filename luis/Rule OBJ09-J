/*
OBJ09-J: Compare classes and not class names 

When wanting to compare the values in a class for verification or one 
to another, ensure you do not just check a class’ name but rather its true class value. 

By avoiding simply calling, say, an equals() to a class’ name, 
calling some kind of getClass() method and acquiring its class truly will prevent 
malicious attempts to have unqualified classes from passing through just because 
it has the same name as the qualified class.

if(x.getClass() == y.getClass()){
  //Objects have the same class
}

//...

if(x.getClass() == com.application.auth.DefaultAuthenticationHandler.class){
  //Object x has correct name
}
